# Modeling_RRLyrae_Signals
To model contamination from a background RR Lyrae star in TESS data

Given that the TESS observations have a large field of view, a lot of stars can contaminate the data of your star of interest. In general, this is not a huge problem, given that TESS detects plants by variation of light due to a planet passing in front of its host star. Since, stars' variation is marginal compared to the signal caused by a transiting planet, the overall effect of a background star doesn't hinder in the measurements of the passing planet. However, for the case of HATS-29b, there was an RR Lyrae star in the background. The variation of the RR Lyrae star had a frequency higher than that of the planet transit and a signal multiple times greater. Thus, the features of the planet transit could not be model until the RR Lyrae background signal was modeled out. This code does just that, by first modeling the features (period, amplitude, and asymmetric structure) of the RR Lyrae signal. Then it subtracts out that signal allowing for analysis of the transit of interest.

This routine was implemented and utilized in McGruder et. al. 2022 (ADS link: [https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...944L..56M/abstract](url))
